# Missing OIDC Claims

This error means that there are no "OIDC" claims added to the server configuration when the server was created.

## How to fix it

Add at least one claim to the OIDC configuration for the application.

For example, 

```yaml
----
server:
  authentication: 
    oidc:
      callback_url: "https://your-site/.well-known/oidc-callback"
      provider: "https://accounts.google.com"
      claims:
        # Issuer is present on all Google Single Sign tokens and can be validated against.
        - iss: "https://accounts.google.com"
```
