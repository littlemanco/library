# Empty set of OIDC Claims supplied

This error indicates that while OIDC claims were supplied, the set that was supplied was empty.

That is, instead of:

```json
{
    "claims": {
        "foo": "bar"
    }
}
```

There is only:

```json
{
    "claims": {}
}
```

(Or there is nothing at all)

## How to fix it

Add at least one claim to the OIDC configuration for the application.

For example, 

```yaml
----
server:
  authentication: 
    oidc:
      claims:
        # Issuer is present on all Google Single Sign tokens and can be validated against.
        - iss: "https://accounts.google.com"
```
